This is the front and backend code for the LocalReach website.

The backend is written in Python using the Django framework. To edit the code on one's own computer, first you must install git and clone the repository to your own computer.
Cloning can either be done in git bash or using VSCode's simple tools (you have to sign in with GitHub). Once the repository is cloned then you can edit the code and run the
server locally with the command *python manage.py runserver*
